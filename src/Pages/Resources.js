      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        Since web development is a collaborative field, our work is extensively
        shaped by others. Any problem you might run into has probably already
        been solved many different ways. Frameworks and libraries provide a set
        of solutions for others to access. This leads us to rely heavily on
        documentation. Any framework or library worth using has documentation
        worth reading. <br />
        <br />
        The following list contains resources for understanding and making use
        of a wide variety of web technologies. If these aren’t already in your
        bookmarks, they need to be.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP</h2>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>MDN</h2>
          <p>
            The Mozilla developers network is your one-stop shop for
            documentation on essential web technologies. Anything you want to
            know about ecmascript, css, html,php and more are there.
          </p>

          <h1>Documentation</h1>
          <h2>Official Publications</h2>w3c, ecma international, whatwg
          <p>
            HTML, CSS and Javascript are developed and specified by these
            organizations. They provide authoratative information on web
            technologies, but are too broad for quick-reference. If you have a
            more narrow concern (like how to center a fixed element), you will
            likely need help from the resources on the next list instead.
